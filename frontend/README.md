## Compiling

To compile the TypeScript source code to JavaScript, install
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

```bash
cd js
npm install
npm run build
```

## Viewing

[index.html](index.html) contains the survey's markup, but it is typically used
in a container. By default, it expects compiled JavaScript files in the same
directory, so copy [index.html](index.html) and the compiled JavaScript into one
directory.
